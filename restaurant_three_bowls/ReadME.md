## Project Restaurant

##### _The project is far from completion. Therefore, this project can be considered as a sketch._ 



> The idea is to create a website in monochrome colors at first. 
> Primary structure: Create html template in which video, pictures and texts are inserted. 
> Secondary structure (what needs to be done in further steps): Colorizing this project and applying the chosen  direction of style, finding fonts that match the style as well as graphic material processing.
